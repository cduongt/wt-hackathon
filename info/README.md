# Winding Tree Hackathon #3 information - London, UK

Keep in mind that hackathons are kind of like marathons. Some people participate to compete and win, but most people take part to learn something new and have fun. Whatever the reason is you’re joining us, make sure you’re honoring the hacker spirit by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.

## Judges

Comittee group of travel experts, engineers, sponsors and Winding Tree core team members.

## Judging Criteria

Big inspiration of Winding Tree hackathon juding process were always
[ETH hackathons](https://medium.com/ethberlin/open-sourcing-our-judging-process-75b77f6ba459).
In a nutshell, we are looking at these 4 categories:

* Technicality: How hard was it to build this and how does the quality of the codebase compare?
* Originality: Is this something completely new or are there already projects with grant funding working on a similar scope?
* Practicality: How would this submission survive in the real world?
* WOW Factor: What else is there about the submission? Is it using Winding Tree platform?

## Prizes

Read about the challenges and prizes in [our announcement blogpost](https://blog.windingtree.com/announcing-official-hacktravel-london-2019-hackathon-challenges-9f83a8e70444).

## Hack Projects

- You can choose any idea to work on, but you should present only what you created during the hackathon.
- To make it a bit easier to choose an idea — we’re offering [industry challenges](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-hackathon/issues) as an inspiration to you. Hacking one of those helps to solve real industry pain points & qualifies for more prizes.
- The hack project MUST be open source. Don't forget to [add a license](https://choosealicense.com/).
- All work on the project must be done at the hackathon.
- Your project should be publicly accessible if possible. It will make judging easier. If it's not publicly hosted, provide a guide on how to run it locally. Thank you!

## Teams

- You’ll have a chance to meet fellow hackers, discuss ideas and form teams during social times, breakfast, lunch and right after the introductory talks. Check out the [full schedule](https://windingtree.com/hacktravelprogram).
- At the time of forming teams (2:00pm-2:30pm Nov 4th) you will have the opportunity to propose your hack idea to the crowd and invite hackers to join your team. Not everyone will author an idea and that’s fine — if you don’t have one, just join another team.
- All teams must be open for accepting team members. In the spirit of an open source technology hackathon — no closed/private teams please.
- We don’t have minimum or maximum size for a team, but keep it fair. A team with over 6–7 members might end up having purely people-hours advantage over a 2 members team. If your idea attracted a lot of people — split it up into several projects tackling different angles.
- We encourage everyone to spend some time to share your knowledge with others - meet the teams, learn what they are working on, offer help, brainstorm, research, provide peer review & feedback, contribute code and have a good time.

## Submissions

See [submissions](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-hackathon/tree/master/submissions) folder.

## Presenting

- Every project will get presented at Nov 6 2PM. We prefer to show the presentation from a presenter's laptop to speed things up (but if you have full HDMI port, it should be fine).
- Each presentation is 3 minutes long + 5 minutes for questions and feedback. We encourage your entire team to come up in front of the audience.
- The order of presentations will be determined and announced on the spot.
- All teams are highly encouraged to present their hack to the community. It’s OK if you haven’t finished and your hack is not in its perfect state. The community and the judges will want to see the evidence of your effort and persistence in solving your challenge.
- In case you don’t have anything to demo, you can still present your idea, what you tried out and what you learned in the process.
