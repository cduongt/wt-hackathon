## Repository

https://github.com/BowsilAmee/eyvisitad/

## Description
Simple and straight forward 

1. Download the repository
2. npm install 
3. Run Application using npm start command 

## Problems
Need for a seamless distribution mechanism of Abu Dhabi layover packages (flights, hotels and tourist activities) for guests. Push more pacakages even as a part of regular flight shopping to the guests. No channelized and unified way of distributing these packages to the internet today. We're dependent on OTAs to build these packages and distribute them or we build them on our own and offer it only through the direct channel distribution which restricts the volumes and out reach for such pacakages. 

## Solution
As an Abu Dhabi stopover visitor, you'll enjoy attractive savings on flights, hotels, car hire and local excursions. Booking an Abu Dhabi Stopover is now made simple. Select packages during the flight itinerary shopping flow (either through an OTA or meta or google), either the passenger or the travel agent would seamlessly be able to shop and select stopover packages offered via this unified "Visit Abu Dhabi" APIs. These APIs package all the Abu Dhabi flights, hotels, local excurions - and offer you the best deals possible in the market place. 
Winding Tree hotels content will be packaged along with Etihad flights to serve the guests. Open APIs that are available for distribution to the internet. We rely on winding tree primarily for two purposes: to establish the trust value of the API consumer, and smart contracts for the hotel inventory. 

Further, we have integrated with IBM Watson chatbot to display a smart UI layer to display such packaged offers - this consumes the API to access the content. 

## We learned
1. WindingTree as a new distribution market place for hotels
2. Blockchain technology and its application
3. OrgID, Smart contract in blockchain
