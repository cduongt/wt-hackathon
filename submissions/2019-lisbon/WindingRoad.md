## Description

As a ancillary provider I want to expose my services to the outside world. Through connecting to the Winding Tree platform everybody can find me and connect to my data.

## Problems
There's a lot of servicing companies in travel, but they are not able to be found automatically.

## Solution
By creating a new segment directory besides the current Hotel and Airline content producers, we're able to extend the platform and give parties like OTA's the ability to consume this data. These ancillaries can be anything from providing services like insurances or user interfaces to providing a notification service to travellers.
We a Roadmap wanted to be a ancillary provider and provide our frontend where all your bookings are visible (with the possibilities for upselling for example).

## We learned
1. You can't add a new segment directory as an external party. You need to be owner of the contract for that. That owner is Winding Tree. As a open platform it might make sense to make it more accessible to add certain content.
2. It's not clear what existing code is ready to be improved upon or what is just made as a prototype.
3. Extending e.g. the read API takes a lot of work because of lacking a modular approach.
4. In general: Where and when Winding Tree is useful and how to achieve trust in  decentralized identities.
