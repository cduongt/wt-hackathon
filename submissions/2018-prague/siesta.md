Description
We tried to connect WT with our existing Siesta Solution (Siesta) hotel management - export real-life hotel data, submit booking and pay for the 
booking using ethereum cryptocurrency. In other words, in this limited time scope we tried to put Winding Tree to
production environment "as much as possible" by going through the whole "hotel lifecycle" - we exported a hotel from Siesta with
custom offchain URL, we customized the URL so the user could actualy book the rooms. The booking and payment then
get processed and returned back to our system.


Problems
We faced diverse variety of technical problems and several communication and validation issues.


Solution
Our goal was to create a general-purpose .NET library that would simplify the connection to WT network and
do all the "unnecessary" blockchain stuff for you.


We learned
We learned the Winding Tree platform could be realisticaly used in production even now in its current state. 
However, there is still lots of work to do on WT side - in our eyes the main goal of WT now should be to
simplify the access to the WT ecosystem for wider audience.
