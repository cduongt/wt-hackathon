## Description
The project is the attempt to implement proxy re-encryption mechanism for managing private data for the hotels stored on WT smart contract.

## Problems
There is a need for hotel managers or travel managers to store some private data (corporate discounts, for example) in public blockchain. So they need a mechanism to grant access rights to some groups of their clients.
## Solution
Proxy re-encryption mechanism for one Manager and one or several client was successfully implemented. More time is needed to implement the UI for the both roles. For Manager to add/remove/delete public keys of clients that are allowed to read private data. For a client to view list of all hotels with discounts decrypted.
## We learned
how to read/write/update hotel information with WT API
how the proxy re-encryption mechanism can be implemented by Nucypher pyUmbral limbrary
