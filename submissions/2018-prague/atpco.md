## Description
Descentrelized traveler profile owned and controlled by the traveler who decides which airline can see which parts of their profile preferences at the time of any specific NDC request/response. 

For Example, to an specific airline an air shop request shares frequent flyer number and cabin preference, 
seat availavility request shares seat preferences; and for the same air shop request different airlines get different profile information controlled by the traveler.

## Problems
The traveler wants to get customized offers but control the information shared with the airlines. Also the airlines wants to provide customized offers to the traveler and to limit liabilities with privacy concerns.

## Solution
Used a Swarm descentralized database to store and secure the traveler profile information. Added a layer for easier interation with the database, without sacrificing security.

## We learned
A lot about Swarm, and block chain, and Winding Tree. Learned about how this technologies can be used in the Air Travel industry
