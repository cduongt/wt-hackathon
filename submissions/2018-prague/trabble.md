  - Integration of Trabble's ChatBot with Winding Tree's repository, enabling automation of booking and payments seamlessly through chat, without any need for technical development.
  
  - Second Layer solutions
  - Bring Off Chain Payments to WT with Liquidity Network 
  
  - With Trabble's solutions, we will be able to pull and push inventory to Winding Tree's ecosystem and enable payments and booking in a seamless guest experience. Potentially as an "OTA", Winding Tree's customers are able to leverage on the Inventory Management, self creation of Bots and Booking Engine for their Guest Engagement. Loyalty would also then be possible within the system.
  
  - There are still many of the functionalities that Winding Tree is building that is still in it's early stages, Trabble will eventually be able to integrate our inventory to Winding Tree's wt-update-api to allow for the ecosystem to grow.
