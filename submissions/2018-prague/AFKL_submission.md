## Description
We implemented a first solution to adapt Winding Tree Hotelarchitecture to airline business.
We integrated calls to the new distribution standard (NDC) API of two airlines : Air France - KLM and Lufthansa.
We also developed a search API so that the end-user can make one query on all the airlines that are part of the index.


## Problems
- Integration with Airlines API
- NDC output parsing was a pain because of the complexity/size of the response sent by APIs
- Removing the off-chain storage to replace it by NDC calls implied being able to use the dataUri field to later build an API request

##Solution

## We learned
- WE LEARNED ABOUT THE WINDING TREE ARCHITECTURE!! :)
- How to deploy a smart contract on Ropsten
- Tried to discover Swarm data storage
