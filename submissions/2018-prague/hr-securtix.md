•Project description.

In case a passenger with an airline ticket is affected by the insolvency of its interline partners. Ticket issuing carrier make a full refund of the unused part of the ticket including taxes. 

•Problems that you are solving.

The current process is as follows
1.Passenger contacts travel agency where his ticket was purchased
2.Travel agency submits refund application (RA) via BSP Link to the carrier according to its Refund Policy.
3.Airline approves RA and processes the refund via BSP report; for ARC markets refunds will be processed by ACM or authorized via GDS directly
4.Travel agency reimburses the refunded amount to the passenger.

The whole process can be automated with an immediate refund capability using an ethereum based smart contract.

•How did you solve them.

Expose the insolvency refund smart contract to the travel agency. Travel agent app can initiate the refund request with all necessary details. Airline's smart contract will check the external api source to cross chek the insolvency and calculate the refund amount automatically. Airline's smart contract also contacts the insolvency insurance provider instantaneously to refund the reequired amount.
