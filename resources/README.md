## Random tips

- Version your code. Any of [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) are fine. Or use another service, the code has to be publicly accessible and open-sourced though.
- Deployment is always a pain. Don't spend too much time on it. For frontend, we can recommend [now.sh](https://now.sh), [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) or maybe [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). For backend services, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), [free 1st year tier of AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Digital Ocean trial](https://try.digitalocean.com/cloud-hosting/) or maybe [Jelastic](https://jelastic.com/docker/) should work. There are so many options that we might advice on how and where to run your service, but we probably don't know every service out there. A solid recommendation would be to pack your service into an easily portable [docker](https://docker.com) container.
- If you need to host static files, use [now.sh](https://now.sh), [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com) or even [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com) - basically any service that offers direct access to the content (Dropbox for example does not allow that).
- If you need to connect directly to Ethereum, don't spend time on running your own nodes. Feel free to use [Infura](https://infura.io).
- If you'd like to connect to [Swarm](https://swarm.ethereum.org/), use an [existing gateway](https://swarm-gateways.net). If you'd like to connect to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), use an [existing gateway](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/).
- There's a lot of outdated or broken tools and tutorials on Ethereum. Be careful on which version you are using.
- If you're working on smart contracts, you can use an excellent [openzeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) library.
- [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) used to have some serious issues with versioning. Use the [latest documented version (1.2.x)](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) and everything should work.
- If ETH faucets don't work for you, ask us. We should be able to transfer some Ropsten Ether to you.
